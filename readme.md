## Description
The application gives a brief description about Akan Names and its origin.The application then collects information about the user's birthday and gender through a form. It uses the birthday information to calculate the day of the week the user was born and then depending on the user's gender information, the application outputs the Akan Name upon form submission.The application is designed in such a way that the user's information filled in the form must be valid. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements

All the fields in the form must be answered before submission.The application then uses the formula; Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

 where;

 CC - is the century digits. For example 1989 has CC = 19
